This containts sample in C# and java to connect to jobvite apis.   Both the sample contains method to use either pem or der file.Also one can run these samples in Windows,linux or mac. We have used bouncycastle library in both the sample to read pem format file . Again this is not necessary if you are using der library or you can use any other library which provides similar functionality.
